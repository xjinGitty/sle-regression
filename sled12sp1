*** product level mechanism (technical strategy)
1. overall view not support keyboard selection till gnome version 3.2
2. trash with virtual filesystem
3. auto-login only take effect for system boot up login (not include logout/ login)
4. seahorse-plugin has been removed (gpg command to replace it with encrypting and decrypting file with gpg key), and seahorse has posibility been replaced by gpg (including seahorse)
5. notell vpn(openGPL)/ cisco vpn(non-GPL) -- > openVPN (no product different)



*** meeting minutes
1. the rule of how we branch our product???



*** issue to investigate
1. switch between wifi and eth: continous download and connection auto switch (website specific)
